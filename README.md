# Selection Sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.

Best case Time complexity - O(N<sup>2</sup>) <br/>
Worst case Time complexity - O(N<sup>2</sup>) <br/>
Average case Time complexity - O(N<sup>2</sup>) <br/>
Space Complexity - O(1) <br/>
