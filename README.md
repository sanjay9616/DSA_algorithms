# Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort compares two adjacent elements and swaps them until they are in the intended order.

**Steps**
1. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
3. Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
4. The above process goes on until the last element.
5. The same process goes on for the remaining iterations.


Best case Time complexity - O(N) <br/>
Worst case Time complexity - O(N<sup>2</sup>) <br/>
Average case Time complexity - O(N<sup>2</sup>) <br/>
Space Complexity - O(1) <br/>
